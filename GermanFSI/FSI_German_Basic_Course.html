<a name ="Preface"><h3>Preface </h3></a>
<p>This Basic Course in German has been designed to assist United
States Government representatives who require a command of spoken German.
The general concept of this text has grown out of the plan of Spoken
Language courses prepared under the auspices of the American Council of
Learned Societies during World War II. But pattern drills and other
exercises have been developed extensively at the Foreign Service Institute
to provide a much fuller manipulation of forms and patterns. and
a conscious attempt has been made to adapt situations and vocabulary to
specific needs of the Foreign Service. And the course is intended to
lay a solid foundation for comprehensive language skills. providing
systematically for the development of reading proficiency based on oral-aural
skills..</p>

<p>
This text is the end-product of several years of work and has benefited
from the labors of many members and former members of the FSI staff.
In its present form, it was prepared under the supervision of Dr. Samuel A.
Brown. who has had overall responsibility for the arrangement of situational
material and for the organization and presentation of structural features.
Particular credit for the dialogs and much of the drill material
goes to Mrs. Ilse Christoph. Mrs. Christoph has been assisted by Mrs.
Maria-Luise Bissonnette. Mr Friedrich Lehmann. Mr. Gerhard Matzel.
Mrs. Margarete Plischke and Mrs. Erika Ouaid. A most valuable contribution
was also made by Mrs. Quaid in preparing the major part of the
typescript. assisted by Miss Genevi√®ve Ducastel. The project has been
a cooperative venture, however, and all members of the German staff
have contributed freely the fruit of their classroom experience and the
gifts of their imagination and insight.</p>

<a name ="AIM"><h3>AIM</h3></a>
<p>  lt is the aim of the course to provide the student with a useful
control of the structure of the spoken language and of a basic vocabulary
which meets at least some of the specialized needs of the Foreign
Service. After completion of the basic course, the Foreign Service Officer should be able to make limited practical use of the language
in his official duties and social obligations. He will furthermore
have the means, given the proper surroundings and personal motivation,
for continued rapid and efficient development of proficiency.</p>



<a name ="METHOD AND PROCEDURE"><h3>METHOD AND PROCEDURE</h3></a>
<p>This is a course in Spoken German; the forms and patterns of the language are intentionally colloquial. The emphasis in instruction is everywhere on speech, 
and an indispensable component of the learning
process is the voice of a tutor, or instructor, whose native language
is German. On no account should the student attempt to use these
materials without either a native instructor or recordings of a native
instructor's voice. The method of instruction incorporates <u>guided
imitation</u>, <u>repetition</u>, <u>memorization</u>, <u>pattern practice</u>, and <u>conversation</u>.</p>

<p> Working under the supervision of a linguist the tutor's role is to
serve as a model for speech and to guide the student to accurate imitation
by constant repetition and correction. The student's job is to
watch and listen to the tutor carefully and to imitate as exactly as he
can the sounds which he hears. He must be prepared for constant correction
and repetition. Each time however the instructor will give hirn
a model to follow by repeating the item first. The student should
never attempt to read from his text but should always wait until he
hears the word or utterance as the tutor speaks it for him. As far as
possible he should leave his book closed during the presentation of
new dialog material and keep his eyes on the tutor. Students will be
asked to repeat in chorus and individually and will be expected to repeat
many, many times, even when their imitation has been good and
accurate. Only by constant repetition after an authentic model for
speech can habitual fluent and accurate reproduction of the sounds and
forms of the foreign language be achieved. </p>

<p>The <u>basic sentences</u> are preceded by "build-ups" giving the component
parts of the utterance separately. Each new item which is
introduced appears first as a build-up. The tutor will ask the
students to repeat the build-ups separately first, then combined into
larger units and finally the complete new sentence or utterance. The
basic sentences are sub-divided into numbered sections, each to be
treated as a unit, repeated in chorus and individually, with and without
build-ups, until the students' imitation is satisfactory. Then a
new section may be begun. The time required to cover each section in
this way will differ widely depending on the size and ability of the
class.</p>

<p>After acceptable imitation and accurate pronunciation has been
achieved in one or more sections they are assigned for <u>memorization</u>
outside of class or repeated in class until memorized. The student
should be able to give either the German sentence or its English equivalent
on request or switch from one to the other and back again. The tutor will drill by repeating each sentence for each student in the
class, then by giving each student a different sentence, repeating it for
hirn first, and finally asking the students to recite the sentences in
order, the first student the first sentence, the second student the second sentence, etc., without receiving a cue from the instructor.</p>

<p>Repetition outside of class, preferably using recorded materials as a
guide, should be continued to the point of <u>overlearning</u>. The student
should not only be able to give the correct German sentence immediately
upon hearing an English equivalent, at random selection, he should also
be able to give the correct German sentence with equal ease and speed
of response upon hearing its German cue. </p>

<p>As a final step the students
are expected to act out the basic dialog in entirety from memory, with
the tutor or with other students. Only when the basic sentences have
been mastered to this extent can they be considered to provide an adequate basis for control of the spoken language.</p>

<p>It should be noted
at this point that the English text accompanying the basic sentences
is <em>not primarily a translation</em> but rather a set of conversational
equivalents. Many apparent discrepancies will be found if the student, or the tutor, looks for word-for-word correspondence between the
English and German text. It does not exist. Rather, in such and such
a situation <em>this</em> is what is said in German and is what is said in
English.</p>

<p> The  <u>pronunciation practice drills</u> are to be taken up after the
presentation of the basic sentences has been completed and memorization
has been started. Items are arranged in groups according to the particular phonological feature concerned. Words in vertical columns
present the same phonological feature in different environments.
Several columns in a practice group contain  related phonological
features or related phonological environments in which the same feature
recurs. Words are to be repeated first in chorus and then individually
by each student after the tutor, at first following the vertical
columns and later, for variation and comparison, horizontally across
the page.</p>

<p> Particular attention should be paid to items in <u>contrast</u>.
These are minimum meaningfully distinctive sound patterns, accurate
control of which is important for communication and comprehension.
Contrasting word pairs are linked by a dash, and after separate practice
for accuracy, the items should be repeated by pairs to bring out the
exact distinctions between them.</p>

<p>The <u>notes on grammar</u> are earmarked for home study. After each
unit has been started and the first hour or more has been spent in
class on the repetition of the basic sentences the student should read
through the grammar notes to acquaint himself with the grammatical
points presented in that unit. During the whole time a particular unit
is being worked on in class the student should continue to  <u>study</u> the
grammar section. Many questions which he may feel tempted to raise in
class will be found to be answered in the notes on grammar.  <u>The tutor
is specifically requested not to discuss the language with his students,
and the students are asked not to ply him with questions.</u> Time in
class is to be spent using and manipulating the language and not in
talking about it. </p>

<p> In each unit one or more grammatical features are
presented, and the basic sentences have been designed, as far as is
possible consistent with natural expression, to incorporate and illustrate those features.
Each point of grammar discussed is illustrated
by sentences which are natural utterances in the language. They are
taken in nearly every case from the basic sentences of the current or
preceding units. Thus the examples are already familiar to the student,
and the <u>patterns</u> they contain, which will be drilled and practiced in
the sections to follow, are patterns which the student has already
begun to assimilate by memorizing the sentences of the dialog.</p>

<p>After the basic sentences of a unit have all been repeated several
times and memorization has been well begun, work can be started on the
<u>drills</u>. The material is designed to provide a maximum of additional
experience in using the forms and patterns of the language learned in
the basic sentences. It is  <u>not</u> assumed, however, that the learner is
automatically able to transfer the experience gained in the basic
sentences to error-free manipulation of these forms and patterns. The
drills are by no means a test of what the student can do with the
elements given to him. It is a matter of no great importance whether he
can or can not "figure them out" by himself. The goal is to learn to
speak the language <u>accurately</u> and <u>fluently</u>, and this aim can only be achieved by <u>correct</u> repetition of the forms and patterns involved.
Therefore all the sentences in each drill group are first to be
repeated after the tutor in their correct form. The tutor then cues each student in turn for repetition of one of the drill sentences until
all students have given all sentences correctly.</p>

<p>In the <u>substitution drills</u> the model sentence and all its variants
are first repeated in chorus after the tutor. He then gives the model sentence again, the class repeats it in chorus, after which each student
is cued individually with an item to be substituted and repeats the
sentence with the substitution called fore In some eases the cue is
the exact form which fits into the sentence. In some cases a cue is
given which requires the student to choose the proper form to fit the syntactic environment of the model. Regardless of which type of cue
is given or how simple or complex the exercise may appear to be, the
student's task is to make the substitution without hesitation and to
repeat the sentence accurately at normal conversational speed. Although
no English equivalents are given in the substitution drills and the first task is rapid, fluent and accurate manipulation of the material
in <u>German</u>, the tutor may ask for spot translations into English here
and there, and on the second or third repetition of the drill he may
give English equivalents as word or sentence cues in place of the German
cues provided.</p>

<p>In most of the <u>variation drills</u> and in all of the <u>vocabulary drills</u> the cues take the form of equivalent English sentences. The basic procedure remains the same as in the substitution drills. All sentences in a
given variation or vocabulary group are first repeated after the tutor
in their correct form. The tutor then gives the pattern sentence again,
and the students repeat it in chorus, after which they are required
individually to recall and repeat the correct German sentences for which
an English equivalent is given. Students may work with their books
open here, covering up the right-hand side of the page on which the
German sentences are printed and taking their cues from the English
sentences on the left-hand side of the page.</p>
<p><u>Conversion drills </u>require the conversion of one or more elements
in a sentence from one form to another - singular to plural, present
tense to past tense, etc. No English is provided for these sentences
as a rule. However, as in the substitution drills, the tutor may ask for
a random spot translation into English, and he may go through the drill
a second or third time giving English sentence cues for which the student
gives the German equivalent.</p>
<p>Translation and response drills, as noted above, are in most cases
directly related to the basic sentences. In  <u> translation drills</u>, the
procedure is similar to that followed in variation and vocabulary drills.
Students may work with their books open, covering the German text and
reading the English sentences themselves, or if preferred, books may be
left closed while the tutor gives the English equivalents. In the <u>response drills</u>, it is often appropriate for the tutor to address two or three questions to the same student and then two or three more to the
next so that the drill takes on a more natural character of conversation-
al interchange. Both drills should be repeated in entirety several times,
however, or until all students have had a chance to respond to all items.</p>
<p>It will be noted that all drill material is provided with both
a cue and correct response so that all may be prepared by the student
outside of class and repeated and practiced by him as often as necessary
to achieve complete accuracy and fluency. In many cases, there is more than one possible response to a given cue, and instructors are encouraged to accept all responses which are truly equivalent. If a correct response has been given, however, instructors are <u>not</u> to suggest variant forms which may occur to them, as this only introduces unnecessary complexity of choice to an exercise which is difficult enough as it is.</p>

<p>In the <u>conversation practice</u> brief conversations, usually on the
same theme as the basic dialog,  are read through by the tutor three or
four times while students listen. Then the tutor takes one role while
one student takes the other, and they repeat the conversation together.
The student's aim here is not primarily to memorize and repeat exactly,
but to give as accurate an equivalent as possible in his own words.
After acting out the conversation with the tutor the student goes through
it again with another student, he in turn with the next student, and so
on until all have taken both parts in the dialog.</p>
<p>The <u>situations</u> are brief descriptions, in English in the earlier
units, later in German, of occurrences similar to those on which the
basic dialogs are based. Two or more students then act out what has been
described in their own way and using their own words. They are free to
use their imagination and fill in any supplementary details that occur
to them. The whole conversation should not be prolonged however more
than four or five minutes maximum duration. Then other students may
try their hand at the same situation. </p>
<p>The <u>narratives</u>, beginning with the fifth unit, are designed for
reading purposes. In the early units, they introduce a minimum of
additional vocabulary and unfamiliar forms, and they may be used in the
class for oral narration, the student re-telling in his own words what
he has read. In later units, some features of expository prose - matters
of both form and style - which differ from normal spoken usage are
introduced through the narratives in order to bridge the gap between
conversational German and those reading skills of a specialized nature
which require particular study and attention.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of the course, as has been stated above, is to
<u>speak</u> accurately, fluently and easily. The text provides for the
assimilation of all basic forms and patterns of the language by the
guided imitation, memorization, and manipulation of a large number of
sentences and by practice in confronting several widely occurring every-
day situations. Actual living use of the language in free conversation
is a necessary and essential adjunct. The tutor should, therefore,
encourage his students from the start to use the language in every way
possible, above and beyond what is provided for in the text. After the
first few days of work, both students and tutors should avoid the use of
English in the classroom for any purpose at all, and they are encouraged
to speak German outside the classroom as well. Only by the constant use of the skill he is learning can the student hope to master it and retain it
as a useful tool of his profession.</p>
